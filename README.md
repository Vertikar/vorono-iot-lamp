# VoronoIoT Lamp

### Introduction:

This is a simple enclosure that turns your Particle Internet Button into a beautiful, reactive desk lamp. The enclosure is laser cut out of a black acyrlic sheet and requires some assembly.

### You will need:
 - The VoronoIoT Kit
 - Particle internet button with a Photon
 - Glue: hot glue/scotch tape
 - Hobby knife
 - Letter size printer paper x2
 - Patience

### Assembly Guide:

#### Step 1:

The parts come with a protective layer of paper.

#### Step 2:

Peel off the protective paper. You'll need some patience. Don't try this on an empty stomach.

#### Step 3:

You can use hot glue, or scotch tape to put together the lamp. Try not to use super glue since it will stain the surface very easily.

#### Step 4:

Place the Internet button on the bottom plate. You can fix it to the base using a M3 screw and nut or simply hot glue it.

#### Step 5:

In order to defuse the light, you can use a standard printing paper (letter size). Simply fold it into half and cut 0.25" from the edge to make a nice fit. You'll need to glue it place. We have also used tracing paper and acetate paper successfully.

#### Step 8:

Place the top plate on (don't glue it in!). Leave the inside open - it will project some cool patterns on the ceiling when the lamp turns on.

#### Step 9:

Follow the steps to program the internet button and turn it ON!
